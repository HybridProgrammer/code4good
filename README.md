# About
Demo of the project we presented at [Code4Good](http://code4goodpbc.org/) 2015 Hackathon. We had 24 hours to develop a
 solution to solve a problem for a nonprofit organization.

# The Organization
* Vita Nova: www.vitanovainc.org

Vita Nova has three locations that provide services for older foster youth ages 18-25. These include our residential apartments,
main office and thrift store.

On any given day, and any given location we are presented with challenges related to a young person disconnected from
resources after leaving foster care. These include: homelessness, hunger, lost important documentation, missing healthcare or
help with work or school. Calls from recipients start as early as 7:30 some mornings and a we find that most crisis happen on
holidays or Fridays after 4:30pm.

No matter what the situation or when we get a call our participants are always treated with a sense of respect and urgency. We
know that every interaction from Vita Nova has the potential to save or improve a life.

## Problem to be addressed
In our world the time it takes for our clients to request a referral and receive the service can be the difference between life and
death. Unfortunately, social service agencies do not have budgets to quickly connect those who are struggling with resources
they need in the fastest time possible. Oftentimes, foster youth cannot get help when they need it most. How can we get foster
youth help when it is required?

## Solution
* Set up a text messaging number, a web app and a phone app where youths in need can reach out to the right support provider in the shortest time possible.
* Service provider(s) receives real-time notifications of User activity and resource request.
* User profile can be generated and retained in the database to streamline the process of making a referral to appropriate service provider(s).
